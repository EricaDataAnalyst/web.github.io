					<h2>Glimpse of my educational & work experience</h2>

					<p>As a BI data analyst, I always try to learn new technologies or catch up the trend. Since you never know if tomorrow there is going to be a new framework or new technology that will change the way we work. 
					   Besides these tool that I worked with in daily work, I'm continuing to learn more data integration and machine learning models. Feel free to check out my projects! </p>

					<h2>What brings me to BI?</h2>
					<p>When I was pursuing my bachelor degree, the Covid pandemic just hit the entire world. My hometown, Wuhan, was the headquarter of this pandemic. By that time, all people were afraid about what will happen to their family,
					while having no idea about what's going on. I used to be one of them.</p>
					<p>The turning point was CovidNet, a platform tracking real-time Covid information. After reading their heatmap and trend charts, I got awared about the situation, and I found how powerful that visuals could be.
					    This experience encouraged me to work as a research assistant for Covid Mitigation Project(NSF), and carried me to Business Analytics. </p>
					<p>
						Now I'm well versed with Business Intelligence design and business sense, and I'm willing to carry my skills to company for better business solution!
